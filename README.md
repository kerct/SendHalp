# SendHalp

SendHalp is an app that aims to get you immediate help from your vicinity and acts as a personal blackbox should unfortunate events befall its user.
This app can be used by anybody and is particularly built with the vulnerable in mind. This app will allow you to select your trusted individual and allow you to
send critical information to them during an emergency.

## Background

When unfortunate events to us occur, will **anyone** know? In our current world today, we see many people, especially children and the vulnerable, falling off the grid. This could be due to a multitude of reasons, be it an onset of sickness, kidnapping or other dire conditions.
SendHalp aims to plug this gap through the use of a very well-established, orthodox device we all have. The mobile phone.
Considering just Singapore, the tiny island nation boasts a mobile phone penetration rate of 154.1%. Leveraging on this, SendHalp has the potential to be each and everyone's personal blackbox. 
With SendHalp, **somebody** will look out for you.

## Inspirations
