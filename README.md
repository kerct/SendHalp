SendHalp is an app that aims to get you immediate help from your vicinity and acts as a personal blackbox should unfortunate events befall its user.
This app can be used by anybody and is particularly built with the vulnerable in mind.

## Background

When unfortunate events to us occur, will **anyone** know? In our current world today, we see many people, especially children and the vulnerable, falling off the grid. This could be due to a multitude of reasons, be it an onset of sickness, kidnapping or other dire conditions.
SendHalp aims to plug this gap through the use of a very well-established, orthodox device we all have. The mobile phone.
Considering just Singapore, the tiny island nation boasts a mobile phone penetration rate of 154.1%. Leveraging on this, SendHalp has the potential to be each and everyone's personal blackbox. 
With SendHalp, **somebody** will look out for you.
